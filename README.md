# How to use

First install the needed dependancy with python pip if you haven't already such as ```pip install nltk```
Then run ``python 4score.py``, the results will be saved as ``results.txt`` results can be viewed after running the script; if you'd like to view the results again enter in your terminal of choice ``cat results.txt`` or open it in a text editor.
Addtionaly you may edit the python script to use an online wordlist; that will be pointed out inside the script if you ever decide to open it.
